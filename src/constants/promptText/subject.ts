/**
 * Section 0's worked example of one consistent scale, per category.
 *
 * "One consistent scale across every component" is an abstract rule, and the example after the colon
 * is what makes it land — so the example has to name pieces the sheet actually contains. It was
 * written once, for a character, and reached all six categories: a vehicle sheet was told to keep a
 * hand in proportion to a torso it has neither of, which is the same defect as section 1 labelling a
 * turret "Anatomy base".
 *
 * Each phrase names the smallest and the largest piece that category's own sheet plans ask for — a
 * fitting against the body it is mounted on — and reads on from "One consistent scale across every
 * component: ", so each is a lower-case clause with no trailing stop.

  CHARACTER: 'a hand drawn beside a torso is in proportion to it',
  CREATURE: 'a foot or claw drawn beside the body it belongs to is in proportion to it',

  ITEM: 'a pommel drawn beside the body or shaft it caps is in proportion to it',
  BUILDING: 'an awning drawn beside the wall bay it hangs on is in proportion to it',
  VEHICLE: 'a lamp housing drawn beside the hull it is mounted on is in proportion to it',
  // Neither of the last two is a fitting against the body it is mounted on, because neither sheet has
  // a body. An effect's components are one phenomenon at successive moments, so the scale that can go
  // wrong is between its core and the secondary layer drawn on its own frames beside it; a terrain's
  // tiles are all one size by construction, so it is between a tile and the features standing on it.
  EFFECT: 'a smoke frame drawn beside the core frame it trails is in proportion to it',
  TERRAIN: 'a boulder drawn beside the ground tile it stands on is in proportion to it',
