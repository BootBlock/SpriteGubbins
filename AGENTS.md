# Agent instructions

This file is the cross-agent (AGENTS.md) entry point. The full working conventions live in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) — **read it before making changes.** This file is deliberately a pointer,
not a copy: it repeats in full only the rules whose cost of being missed is unrecoverable, and
links the rest.

The **specification** — what to build, in five phases, with the complete field/option/tooltip
inventory — is [docs/todo/sprite-gubbins-spec.md](docs/todo/sprite-gubbins-spec.md).

## Mandatory rules — the complete list

Every rule below is mandatory. The first three are spelled out on this page; the rest are one
click away and are **equally binding** — "I only read AGENTS.md" is not a defence.

| Rule | Where |
| --- | --- |
| No secrets in the repository | 🔒 below |
| Public-repository hygiene | 🌐 below |
| Attribution on GitHub issues and PRs you write | ✍️ below |
| Design tokens, not hard-coded colour/motion values | [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#design-tokens-are-mandatory-where-one-exists) |
| The structural laws — <150 lines, one thing per file, SoC by directory, YAGNI, DRY, no stubs | [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#architecture-the-specs-structural-laws) |
| The banned patterns, and which ones the build catches | [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#banned-patterns-and-which-ones-the-build-catches) |
| Cross-origin isolation is load-bearing — it decides which database the app gets | [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#cross-origin-isolation-is-load-bearing) |
| Accessibility wiring — roles, labels, live regions, focus | [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#accessibility-is-not-optional) |
| Plan docs under `docs/todo/` carry a status banner | [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#plan-docs-carry-a-status-docstodo) |
| How to verify a change before calling it done | [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#verifying-a-change) |

**Adding a rule to CLAUDE.md? It belongs in that table too.**

## 🔒 No secrets in the repository (mandatory)

This is a **public** repository. Committing a secret is treated as a build-breaking error —
secrets are effectively permanent once pushed (they live in history and may be scraped within
seconds), so the only safe rule is to never let one in.

**Hard rules — these are not negotiable:**

- **Never** write an API key, token, password, secret, private key, certificate, OAuth
  client secret, session cookie, or connection string into any tracked file — including
  source, tests, fixtures, docs, comments, config, and commit messages. Use an obvious
  placeholder (`<YOUR_API_KEY>`, `sk-xxxx`) when an example is genuinely needed.
- **This app never handles a model API key.** It composes prompt *text* for the user to paste
  into a model themselves — it makes no outbound model calls. A change that proposes an API
  key field, an image-generation request, or a proxy is a new architecture, not an increment:
  stop and raise it.
- **Never** commit real personal data: private email addresses, phone numbers, real names
  tied to private accounts, internal hostnames, or IP addresses. Use the GitHub `noreply`
  identity (`BootBlock@users.noreply.github.com`), `example.com` / `*.test` domains, and
  `localhost` in examples and tests.
- **Secrets belong in `.env` only.** `.env` and `.env.*` are git-ignored. Read configuration
  from the environment at runtime — never inline it.
- **Never** commit data artefacts that may carry real content: `*.sqlite`/`*.db`, database
  dumps, exported prompt archives, `.pem`/`.key`/`.pfx`/`.p12`/keystores, or `id_rsa*`.
- **Before every commit, self-audit the diff.** Run `git diff --cached` and scan for
  anything credential-shaped or personal. If a secret is in doubt, leave it out and ask.
- **If a secret is ever committed, stop.** Treat it as compromised: it must be rotated/revoked
  at the source, and the history scrubbed — removing it in a later commit is **not**
  sufficient. Surface this immediately rather than quietly continuing.

## 🌐 Public-repository hygiene (mandatory)

Everything here — code, comments, commit messages, branch names, docs, and history — is
**world-readable and permanent**. Write it as if a stranger will read it tomorrow, because
they can.

- **Stay professional and neutral.** No profanity, disparaging remarks, jokes at anyone's
  expense, or venting in code, comments, or commit messages. No TODOs that name or blame a
  person.
- **No internal-only references.** Don't embed private ticket IDs, internal wiki/Jira/Slack
  URLs, internal hostnames, server names, or other infrastructure details a stranger
  shouldn't see. Describe the *what* and *why*, not internal plumbing.
- **Prompt content is user-facing copy.** Field options, tooltips and preset names ship in the
  bundle and are read by strangers. Keep them descriptive and neutral.
- **Dependency & IP hygiene.** Don't paste code from sources with an incompatible or unknown
  licence; prefer writing it or using a properly-attributed, licence-compatible dependency.
  Vet new dependencies before adding them and keep the surface minimal. This repo is licensed
  **MIT** (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)) — keep `package.json`'s `license` field consistent with it.
- **Keep the ignore rules tight.** Before committing a new kind of generated or local file,
  confirm it belongs in the repo; if it's a build artefact, local cache, or could contain
  real data, add it to `.gitignore` instead.

## ✍️ Attribution on GitHub content (mandatory)

Anything **you** post or edit on GitHub on the maintainer's behalf must disclose that an agent
wrote it. This covers **every** issue and pull-request **comment**, and every issue/PR
**description or body** you author or edit. Attribution is disclosure, not internal process, so
it always stays — unlike the plumbing that must never leak (see above).

Append it as the **last lines**, after a `---` rule, wording the verb to match what you did
(`actioned` / `opened` / `updated`, and `pull request` in place of `issue`):

```markdown
---
This issue was actioned by an agent on behalf of @BootBlock.
```

Omit it only when GitHub gives you no body to sign (e.g. adding a label); if in doubt, include
it. This does **not** apply to git commit messages — those carry a `Co-Authored-By` trailer
instead. Full detail in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#agent-attribution-on-github-content-mandatory).

## ⚠️ Use design tokens, not hard-coded values

Every colour and motion value in the UI must come from a **design token** in the `@theme` block
of [src/index.css](src/index.css) — never a raw hex, `rgb()`/`oklch()` literal, or an ad-hoc
Tailwind palette class. Unknown Tailwind utilities **fail silently**, so verify a new one
actually emits CSS. Full table and the two documented exceptions in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#design-tokens-are-mandatory-where-one-exists).
